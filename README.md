This repository contains a NextJS starter app built on top of the [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses).
It leverages built-in tools ([web search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=responses) and [file search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search)) and implements a chat interface with multi-turn conversation handling.

Features:

- Multi-turn conversation handling
- Web search tool configuration
- Vector store creation & file upload for use with the file search tool
- Function calling
- Streaming responses & tool calls
- Display annotations

This app is meant to be used as a starting point to build a conversational assistant that you can customize to your needs.
